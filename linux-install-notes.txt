We are primarily using CAVASS under OpenSUSE Linux.  Here are the steps we 
follow to install it.  The procedure will most likely be somewhat different 
on other Linux/Unix systems.

You need to install Gnome development software, cmake, and libtiff-devel.
  Use the Software Management tool. You can find it in the Control Center 
  (YaST).  Search for gtk3-devel.  Check the box and apply the change.  The 
  rest of the Gnome development software (cc, c++, make), if it doesn't come 
  with gtk3-devel, and libtiff-devel can be installed in the same way. 
You also need to install wxWidgets:
go to wxwidgets.org, download wxWidgets-3.1.0.tar.bz2 (or latest version),
tar xjf wxWidgets-3.1.0.tar.bz2
cd wxWidgets-3.1.0
mkdir buildgtk
cd buildgtk
../configure --with-gtk
make
[wait]
su
[enter password]
make install
/sbin/ldconfig
exit

Then you install CAVASS:
tar xzf cavass-src-1_0_4.tgz
mkdir cavass-build
cd cavass-build
ccmake ../cavass
c [configure]
e [exit help]
go down to CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, enter, type "Release", enter
t [toggle advanced mode]
go down to CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS, enter, type "-lm -ltiff", enter
c [configure]
e [exit help]
g [generate and exit]
make
[wait]
in /etc/profile.local put the commands:

VIEWNIX_ENV=~/cavass-build
PATH=$PATH:~/cavass-build
export PATH VIEWNIX_ENV

but instead of ~ put the directory where cavass-build is.  Those commands will 
take effect on your next login.

You may have to change your appearance settings for GTK applications to make
the button labels readable.
